  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a novel, low cost flowmeter suitable for application in disposable breathing circuits. The sensor consists of two nominally identical transistors employed as hot sensing elements, placed into a pipe where the fluid flows. The working principle is based on the convective heat transfer between the transistors, heated by Joule effect, and the colder hitting gas. The proposed design allows the sensor to discriminate flow direction. The sensor response has been numerically simulated, and the results validated by experimental trials varying the pipe diameter (i.e., 10 and 30 mm), the flowrate values (ranging from - 8 to 8 L/min), and the collector current (i.e., 100, 300, and 500 {mA}). Experimental results show that the configuration with a pipe diameter of 10 mm at the highest collector current guarantees the highest mean sensitivity (1143 {mV}/L· min-1) at low flowrate (i.e., ±1 L/min); in addition, this configuration ensures the minimum dead space (0.5 versus 5 {mL} for 30 mm of diameter). However, the 30-mm pipe diameter allows extending the range of measurement (up to ±8 versus ±3.5 L/min at 10 mm), and improving both the discrimination threshold ({\textless};0.1 L/min) and the symmetry of response. The response time of the sensor is 340 ms. These characteristics together with the low dead space and low cost foster its application to neonatal ventilation.},

  abstract     = {This paper examines critical aspects of sensors and measurement instruments used in the clinical care of mechanically ventilated newborn babies. The key variables for ventilator control are described and sensors for gas flow and volume are evaluated. The continuous real-time monitoring of critical physical and chemical variables can provide important data that can be used to optimize mechanical ventilator parameters. The options for invasive and noninvasive measurement approaches are introduced and issues relating to the trade-offs between measurement precision and accuracy and patient safety are discussed. Sensors for blood gases, hemodynamic variables, pulmonary mechanics parameters, and ventilator characteristics are described. Accurate gas flow sensors are needed for the effective delivery of an optimized ventilator therapy; the hot-wire anemometer and the pneumotachograph are evaluated. A preliminary study to develop a rationale based on artificial intelligence decision trees for choosing sensors and instruments is presented.},

  abstract     = {A Venturi-type flow sensor has been designed and fabricated for neonatal respiratory assistance to control airway pressure and tidal volume. As the low flow range and sensing principle require the measurement of correspondingly very low pressures, a very responsive sensor, based on a polymer membrane acting onto a piezoresistive cantilever force sensor based on low-temperature co-fired ceramic ({LTCC}), was developed. This paper details the 3D modelling, manufacture, assembly and characterisation of the sensor. Compared to expensive and fragile {MEMS}-based devices, this sensor, based on {LTCC}, thick-film technology and polymer parts, provides an accurate and robust, yet low-cost alternative.},
