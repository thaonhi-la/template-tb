  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a novel, low cost flowmeter suitable for application in disposable breathing circuits. The sensor consists of two nominally identical transistors employed as hot sensing elements, placed into a pipe where the fluid flows. The working principle is based on the convective heat transfer between the transistors, heated by Joule effect, and the colder hitting gas. The proposed design allows the sensor to discriminate flow direction. The sensor response has been numerically simulated, and the results validated by experimental trials varying the pipe diameter (i.e., 10 and 30 mm), the flowrate values (ranging from - 8 to 8 L/min), and the collector current (i.e., 100, 300, and 500 {mA}). Experimental results show that the configuration with a pipe diameter of 10 mm at the highest collector current guarantees the highest mean sensitivity (1143 {mV}/L· min-1) at low flowrate (i.e., ±1 L/min); in addition, this configuration ensures the minimum dead space (0.5 versus 5 {mL} for 30 mm of diameter). However, the 30-mm pipe diameter allows extending the range of measurement (up to ±8 versus ±3.5 L/min at 10 mm), and improving both the discrimination threshold ({\textless};0.1 L/min) and the symmetry of response. The response time of the sensor is 340 ms. These characteristics together with the low dead space and low cost foster its application to neonatal ventilation.},

The key variables for ventilator control are described and sensors for gas flow and volume are evaluated. The continuous real-time monitoring of critical physical and chemical variables can provide important data that can be used to optimize mechanical ventilator parameters. The options for invasive and noninvasive measurement approaches are introduced and issues relating to the trade-offs between measurement precision and accuracy and patient safety are discussed. Sensors for blood gases, hemodynamic variables, pulmonary mechanics parameters, and ventilator characteristics are described. Accurate gas flow sensors are needed for the effective delivery of an optimized ventilator therapy; the hot-wire anemometer and the pneumotachograph are evaluated. A preliminary study to develop a rationale based on artificial intelligence decision trees for choosing sensors and instruments is presented.},

This paper details the 3D modelling, manufacture, assembly and characterisation of the sensor. Compared to expensive and fragile {MEMS}-based devices, this sensor, based on {LTCC}, thick-film technology and polymer parts, provides an accurate and robust, yet low-cost alternative.},

For this purpose, a new high sensitive humidity sensor based on {ZnO}/{ITO} ({ZITO}) composite nanostructure were designed on alumina substrate by sol–gel technique. Step by step monitoring of fabricated substrate after annealing at 400 °C was performed using scanning electron microscopy ({SEM}), energy dispersive X-ray ({EDX}), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ({FTIR}), Raman spectroscopy and {UV}–Vis techniques. An oscilloscope and digital ohmmeter were applied to determine time-varying voltage and resistance signal of the fabricated sensors, respectively, while exposed to various humidity level. Sensitivity, response, recovery time, deposited layers thicknesses, composition ratio of {ZnO}:{ITO} and annealing temperature parameters were considered to achieve optimum conditions. The optimum conditions for maximum sensitivity were obtained as 1:1({ITO}:{ZnO}) ratio, 400 °C annealing temperature, and three times layer by layer coating. Fabricated sensor has excellent response and recovery time (1.0 and 9 s) and long life time at room temperature (25 ± 1 °C) for monitoring human breath and dynamic situation.},
